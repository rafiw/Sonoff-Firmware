# Original Firmwares of ESP

Hello

I decided to establish a database of original firmware of smart switches and the like.
Each file is the version of the board from which it is uploaded. The image of the board is also attached so that it will be possible to identify if we have no documentation on the board.

Hope it will be helpful to you .. even if not good to have.
